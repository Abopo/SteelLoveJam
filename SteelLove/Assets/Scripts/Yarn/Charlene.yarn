*sigh* Hello. 
-> Hello.
    Yeah, hello...
-> Are you alright?
    Not particularly. Things haven't been the same since The Revealing have they?
    I feel like I'm lost, and don't know where to go.
    That's why I have to win this Grand Prix, and find my path again!

It was probably just a fluke though.
I'm no good on my own.

I'm still not in the top 3 though...

Without Gigantimous to lead me, I can't accomplish anything...
