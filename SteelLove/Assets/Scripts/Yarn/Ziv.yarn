I am Ziv Chromebeak. I unknowingly killed my brother.
Somehow, he has been given a second chance.
An unknown entity organized this Grand Prix,
with the apparent prize being a new giant robot built by my brother.
Everyone here has their own desire for a giant robot.
Me? I desire win this race so I can see my brother again.
The ship we are on, "The Break Room", is taking us to our first race.
There is still quite some time before we will reach our desination.

As expected, most of the racers here are inexperienced.
However, there are a few that are close to my skill level.
I shouldn't let my guard down yet.

Hmph, a middling performance in the first race.
I need to pick up the pace if I'm going to win this prix.
Maybe my ship needs a tuning...

The first race went poorly.
It seems my racing skills are quite rusty.
Perhaps I can find a way to...even the odds a bit.
